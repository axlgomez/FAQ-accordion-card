## Hi! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding project.

## The project

In this project I built a **FAQ accordion card**.

You should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size.
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page.
- Hide/Show the answer to a question when the question is clicked.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- BEM
- CSS custom properties
- SASS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript
    * for loops
    * addEventListener
    * setAttribute
    * getAttribute
